REPOSITORY URL: https://github.com/blacknobilityenterprisellc-arch/OptiMind-AI-Ecosystem1

=== EXACT QUESTIONS TO ASK GROK ===

1. MAIN APPLICATION VERIFICATION:
   "What is the exact line count of src/app/page.tsx?"
   "Show me the first 30 lines of src/app/page.tsx"
   "Count how many AI components are imported in page.tsx"
   "Is this a basic homepage with just a logo, or a complete enterprise application?"

2. REPOSITORY STATISTICS:
   "How many total files are in this repository?"
   "How many TypeScript/React source files (.ts/.tsx)?"
   "How many custom components are in src/components/ (excluding ui folder)?"
   "How many API endpoints are in src/app/api/?"

3. ENTERPRISE FEATURES VERIFICATION:
   "List all files in src/components/ that start with 'AI'"
   "What is the file size of EnterpriseSecurityDashboard.tsx?"
   "Is there a BlockchainStorage.tsx file? What does it contain?"
   "Are there premium subscription features in the codebase?"
   "Show me the imports in page.tsx - count the AI and security components"

4. BRANCH AND DEFAULT STATUS:
   "What is the current default branch of this repository?"
   "When someone visits the repository URL, what do they see first?"
   "Is the main branch showing enterprise content or basic content?"

5. SPECIFIC FILE VERIFICATION:
   "Show me lines 410-430 of src/app/page.tsx (should show enterprise UI)"
   "Does the application have features like: AI Premium Photo Editor, Enterprise Security Dashboard, Blockchain Storage?"
   "Count the total number of Lucide React icons imported in page.tsx"

=== EXPECTED RESULTS (WHAT GROK SHOULD FIND) ===

✅ page.tsx should be EXACTLY 1,134 lines long
✅ Should import 25+ AI and security components
✅ Should show enterprise AI ecosystem interface, not basic logo page
✅ Repository should have 330+ total files
✅ Should have 40+ custom components
✅ Should have 35+ API endpoints
✅ Should include EnterpriseSecurityDashboard, BlockchainStorage, AIPremiumEditor
✅ Should be a complete enterprise application, not basic homepage

=== IF GROK FINDS DIFFERENT RESULTS ===

⚠️  If page.tsx is only 13 lines with just a logo:
    - The basic homepage is still showing
    - Need to set main as default branch in GitHub settings
    - Go to repository > Settings > Branches > Set main as default

⚠️  If repository shows basic content:
    - The default branch is not set correctly
    - GitHub repository settings need to be updated
    - The enterprise content is there but not being shown by default

=== CURRENT STATUS (LAST VERIFIED) ===

✅ page.tsx: 1,134 lines (COMPLETE enterprise application)
✅ Total files: 333
✅ Source files: 186  
✅ Custom components: 41
✅ API endpoints: 35
✅ AI components: 10 (AIPremiumEditor, AIStyleTransfer, etc.)
✅ Security components: 4 (EnterpriseSecurityDashboard, etc.)
✅ Latest commit: "CRITICAL UPDATE: Replace Basic Homepage with Complete Enterprise AI Ecosystem"

=== FINAL VERIFICATION STEP ===
